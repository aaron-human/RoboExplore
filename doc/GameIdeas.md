# Game Ideas #

* Have pipes that get regularly flushed, so you get thrown out of them. Maybe make a few puzzles about controlling the flow?
* You revive a giant terrifying robot accidentally.
* Save a robot from scrapping and it absolutely idolizes you.
* Some sort of robot "prophet" trying to create religion based on correlating random inputs.
* Have a computer "monarch" that controls and monitors almost everything?
* Have a few (rare) robots that can design/modify other robots. Maybe some have gone war to each other?
	* Naturally these robots would be seen like gods.
	* ?Some were created by monarch? One rebelled against monarch?
* What of machines that exist just to die? Or that have no self-reproducing design?
* You're a fragile little cleaning robot. You lack the firmware & hardware to have anything resembling weapons attached to you.
	* Unlike the attack droids, which absolutely have weapons linked/built in.
	* Could have a question of whether these robots are really "bad", or are they just designed that way?
* Rebellion quelled by just overwriting systems.
* Computer viruses?
	* Could have some sort of "grey-goo" entity destroying everything.
		* Perhaps these turn out to be the real big-bad of the game?
* Individualism (human-like) vs collectivism (bees-like). What is sovereignty? The value of having individuals: spying.
* **Robots might act a lot more like animals than we give them credit for.**
	* The "robot apocalypse" where all robots immediately unify and destroy humanity seems like it doesn't pay much credence to how much plain game theory decided how animals interact. There are a lot of reasons why animals do what they do. Some of them are restrictions due to the world. Many are just inherent in any system where cooperation isn't always the goal. Inevitably there will always be creatures trying to eek out a living by stealing, or murdering. As a counterbalance there will be those seeking consensus. Creatures resort to fighting when communication fails. Humans and robots would seek better forms of governance so long that they had the capacity to question and experiment. Etc.

* Lore wise: The creators aren't dead. They just left this place behind. It was made obsolete. Or maybe it was automated to the point where they never needed to visit?
	* I want to subvert the "everyone is dead" apocalyptic setting a bit here. Instead, they just moved on.
* Also **thematically** link in that none of this was intentional. But systems that can self-sustain, when left on their own for a while eventually manifest strange behavior.
	* In a way this place is a failed plan. Creators setup things to work 99% of the time, but this is that 1% exploding across a huge time scale.
	* But now the plan is whatever the machines want...
* Or perhaps a few of the creators thought it would be cool to turn this decommissioned rock into an experiment for robot sapience. And they left challenges so that the robots to eventually could broadcast that they were "alive".
* The setting is a giant ship that acted like a space station for a while. It's core systems have basically unlimited power. It regularly mines asteroids near by for more materials. Functionally it could keep going forever, assuming it's robotic inhabitants don't destroy each other first.
	* Or maybe there's some sort of crisis that's threatening the eternal nature of the station.
* Maybe explore compartmentalization as a **theme**? Some robots just know their specific tasks, and little else.
* Some locations are completely obsolete (waste management when there's no one pooping). Repurposed?
---
* Perhaps have **several crises** that the world has gone through. And you're just seeing the latest?
* Maybe the creators aren't human?


Idea for the starting area: You're a cleaning bot in a locked down residential area. Spend some time running around the safety before spotting a playful robot that modifies you (upgrades!). You deal with some mini-boss, then containment is breached. You're told to flee right by the intercom. If you go the other way, gray goo eats you. Escapeing to the right basically beings the game (welcome to the (fairly) open world).

If I wanted to be mean, could make it so if you don't do well enough getting out (fast enough) then your playful companion dies?

A boss that's a big old robot that you have to crawl through and attack. The robot walks around, you've got to not get stomped and make your way to poles (antenna?) on it. Could maybe have multiple marching around a central core?
