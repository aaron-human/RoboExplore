# Game Ideas #

* Have pipes that get regularly flushed, so you get thrown out of them. Maybe make a few puzzles about controlling the flow?
* You revive a giant terrifying robot accidentally.
* Save a robot from scrapping and it absolutely idolizes you.
* Some sort of robot "prophet" tryting to create religion based on correlating random inputs.
* Have a computer "monarch" that controls and monitors almost everything?
* What of machines that exist just to die? Or that have no self-reproducing design?

* Lore wise: The creators aren't dead. They just left this place behind. It was made obsolete. Or maybe it was automated to the point where they never needed to visit?
	* I want to subvert the "everyone is dead" apocalyptic setting a bit here. Instead, they just moved on.
* Also **thematically** link in that none of this was intentional. But systems that can self-sustain, when left on their own for a while eventually manifest strange behavior.
	* In a way this place is a failed plan. Creators setup things to work 99% of the time, but this is that 1% exploding across a huge time scale.
	* But now the plan is whatever the machines want...
* Or perhaps a few of the creators thought it would be cool to turn this decommissioned rock into an experiment for robot sapience. And they left challenges so that the robots to eventually could broadcast that they were "alive".

* Maybe the creators aren't human?
