# Game Ideas #

* Have pipes that get regularly flushed, so you get thrown out of them. Maybe make a few puzzles about controlling the flow?
* You revive a giant terrifying robot accidentally.
* Save a robot from scrapping and it absolutely idolizes you.
* Some sort of robot "prophet" trying to create religion based on correlating random inputs.
* Have a computer Monarch that controls and monitors almost everything. It's the core of everything. It keeps the lights on, and understands how to build/construct/expand _everything_.
* The Monarch has created a few lesser god-like robots that also know how to create other robots and structures. Though none were ever given the same powers as Monarch.
	* Naturally these robots would be seen like gods. Monarch prefers to stay in the background, most assume these "gods" are the only ones.
	* One rebelled against Monarch long ago. It was decisively defeated, but continues to exist under an agreement with Monarch (brokered by another god). Its main legacy is having created a **semi-autonomous zone** at the edge of the city filled with "heretics" who seek some level of separation from Monarch and their systems.
* What of machines that exist just to die? Or that have no self-reproducing design?
* You're a fragile little cleaning robot. You lack the firmware & hardware to have anything resembling weapons attached to you.
	* Unlike the attack droids, which absolutely have weapons linked/built in.
	* Could have a question of whether these robots are really "bad", or are they just designed that way?
* Rebellion quelled by just overwriting systems.
* Computer viruses?
	* Could have some sort of "grey-goo" entity destroying everything.
		* Perhaps these turn out to be the real big-bad of the game?
* Individualism (human-like) vs collectivism (bees-like). What is sovereignty? The value of having individuals: spying.
* **Robots might act a lot more like animals than we give them credit for.**
	* The "robot apocalypse" where all robots immediately unify and destroy humanity seems like it doesn't pay much credence to how much plain game theory decided how animals interact. There are a lot of reasons why animals do what they do. Some of them are restrictions due to the world. Many are just inherent in any system where cooperation isn't always the goal. Inevitably there will always be creatures trying to eek out a living by stealing, or murdering. As a counterbalance there will be those seeking consensus. Creatures resort to fighting when communication fails. Humans and robots would seek better forms of governance so long that they had the capacity to question and experiment. Etc.

* Lore wise: The creators aren't dead. They just left this place behind. It was made obsolete. Or maybe it was automated to the point where they never needed to visit?
	* I want to subvert the "everyone is dead" apocalyptic setting a bit here. Instead, they just moved on.
* Also **thematically** link in that none of this was intentional. But systems that can self-sustain, when left on their own for a while eventually manifest strange behavior.
	* In a way this place is a failed plan. Creators setup things to work 99% of the time, but this is that 1% exploding across a huge time scale.
	* But now the plan is whatever the machines want...
	* Another **theme**, those who have a will control those that don't.
* Or perhaps a few of the creators thought it would be cool to turn this decommissioned rock into an experiment for robot sapience. And they left challenges so that the robots to eventually could broadcast that they were "alive".
* The setting is a giant ship that acted like a space station for a while. It's core systems have basically unlimited power. It regularly mines asteroids near by for more materials. Functionally it could keep going forever, assuming it's robotic inhabitants don't destroy each other first.
	* Or maybe there's some sort of crisis that's threatening the eternal nature of the station.
	* Not sure I like this, it would mean that there couldn't be wide-open areas (usable space is a precious commodity in any ship).
	* Perhaps the main advantage of this is that it makes existence feel hostile; without continual repair the ship would eventually be destroyed by asteroids/etc. The ship, itself, struggles to survive.
	* It could also make for some neat no-gravity levels. Perhaps have one level where the first half is getting to the gravity machine, and the second half is exploring the area with gravity.
* Maybe explore compartmentalization as a **theme**? Some robots just know their specific tasks, and little else.
* Some locations are completely obsolete (waste management when there's no one pooping). Repurposed?
* Another **theme**: automation. Have frequent dumb robots running basic tasks. They're an implicit foil for the main character, who has a will.
* Maybe make the setting a colony on the planet? The core systems were designed to maintain and expand the colony automatically. The creators had mechanical colony "seed ships" that would land on a planet and immediately begin building a space for them to live in. It'd take years, but eventually the colony foundations would be pre-built for them.
	* And this ship is one that's been abandoned. Not because it's bad, just because it's no longer a needed pit-stop.
	* Could have some later levels in a derelict space station above the planet? That'd be neat.
---
* Perhaps have **several crises** that the world has gone through. And you're just seeing the latest?
* Maybe the creators aren't human?
* Have a plot point being that you go in and release a dangerous creature. It runs around terrorizing others.


Idea for the starting area: You're a cleaning bot in a locked down residential area. Spend some time running around the safety before spotting a playful robot that modifies you (upgrades!). You deal with some mini-boss, then containment is breached. You're told to flee right by the intercom. If you go the other way, gray goo eats you. Escaping to the right basically beings the game (welcome to the (fairly) open world).

If I wanted to be mean, could make it so if you don't do well enough getting out (fast enough) then your playful companion dies?

Another starting area idea: have the sector be unpowered, then the power turns on and you see the lights/etc all turning on as electricity flows in from one side. Naturally, you're the last thing that gets turned on.

A boss that's a big old robot that you have to crawl through and attack. The robot walks around, you've got to not get stomped and make your way to poles (antenna?) on it. Could maybe have multiple marching around a central core?

**Level idea** processing facility. Lots of giant vats of chemical death. You start by going through a clear pipe, watching the neat scenery below. Then you hit a spot where the pipe is broken, and fall into the mess below.
