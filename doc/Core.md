# Core Game Idea #

* Core game is just explore/platform + don't die.
* You're weak, so you seldom get to attack anything.
* You're also small and will become very agile. So fighting is going to be the less optimal route.
* You're on a time limit due to your power slowly running dry. You're mainly aiming to find power junctions (which mean unlimited recharging).
	* Most of the time you're left to hunt down battery scraps to stave off running out of juice between main power junctions.
	* The above can be used to reward exploration.
	* ?Could be _really_ nasty and have certain moves drain power?
	* Could have power consumption increase with more power ups.
	* ?Could have a "super mode" that slows time but increases power usage significantly? -- No, this seems like it would break the difficulty too much.
* Lore and characters will be common rewards.
* Upgrades are for more involved sections.
    * ?Or could embrace chaos and have the rewards be fairly randomly scattered?
* Have enemy factions?
* Backgrounds with parallax. Maybe even show adjacent levels as backgrounds/camera dressing for current level

Upgrades:

* Really early: ability to use rails.
* More power (duh)
* More health?
* Drive on metal walls (magnetic).
* Waterproofing.
* Grappling hook. -- This could be too powerful...
