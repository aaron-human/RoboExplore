# Core Game Idea #

* Core game is just explore/platform + don't die.
* You're weak, so you seldom get to attack anything.
* You're also small and will become very agile. So fighting is going to be the less optimal route.
* You're on a time limit due to your power slowly running dry. You're mainly aiming to find power junctions (which mean unlimited recharging).
	* Most of the time you're left to hunt down battery scraps to stave off running out of juice between main power junctions.
	* The above can be used to reward exploration.
	* ?Could be _really_ nasty and have certain moves drain power?
* Lore and characters will be common rewards.
* Upgrades are for more involved sections.
    * ?Or could embrace chaos and have the rewards be fairly randomly scattered?
* Have enemy factions?
* Backgrounds with parallax. Maybe even show adjacent levels as backgrounds/camera dressing for current level?
