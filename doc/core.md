# Core Game Idea #

* Core game is just explore/platform + don't die.
* You're weak, so you seldom get to attack anything.
* You're also small and will become very agile. So fighthing is going to be the less optimal route.
* Lore and characters will be common rewards.
* Upgrades are for more involved sections.
	* ?Or could embrace chaos and have the rewards be fairly randomly scattered?

* Have enemy factions?
